# HIT140_Group_9_Assignment_1
The goal of this project is to find a set of specific features that can tell apart individuals with Parkinson's disease from those without it. We studied the voice recordings of 20 people with Parkinson's and 20 without, with each participant contributing 26 voice samples. These samples were then broken down into various acoustic characteristics using a software named Praat.
